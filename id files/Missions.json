Did the Unbound plant that seed in our collective mythology, presenting itself in a more pleasing form, hoping some mortal would come free it for the price of three wishes? A sobering thought. A being that can bend reality just might have influence in our world, even from its cell. No prison is airtight, as we have unfortunately learnt. Vigilance is our glorious burden.\n\nR. Sonnac"
